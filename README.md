# Roblox Flipbook Packer
Roblox Flipbook Packer is a tool to make spritesheets compatible with flipbooks. Roblox requires flipbook spritesheets to be 2x2, 4x4, or 8x8 and the image to be 1024x1024px.

This tool will pack the sprites into the smallest grid that is compatible and scale the sprites so they fit in a 1024x1024 spritesheet.
